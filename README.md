# AWS Data Engineering Pipeline: Extracting, Transforming, and Analyzing IMDB Data
# Introduction
The "AWS Data Engineering Pipeline: Extracting, Transforming, and Analyzing IMDB Data" project is aimed at demonstrating the implementation of a comprehensive data engineering pipeline using various AWS services. The primary objective of this project is to extract movie data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), transform it into a structured format, and analyze it to derive valuable insights.

This project showcases the end-to-end process of collecting data from a web source, storing it in Amazon S3 buckets, transforming it using AWS Glue, and querying it with Amazon Athena. Additionally, it highlights the challenges encountered during the implementation and how they were addressed.

The project serves as a practical example for data engineers and enthusiasts looking to leverage AWS services for building scalable and efficient data pipelines. By following along with this project, users can gain valuable insights into best practices for working with AWS Cloud infrastructure and data engineering tools.
